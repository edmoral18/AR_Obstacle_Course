# AR_Obstacle_Course
In collaboration with Professor Manuel Hernandez at University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, my team and I created an Augmented Reality Obstacle Course for the Microsoft Hololens, which we developed in Unity Editor. This program was paired with a CueForce C-Mill Treadmill to get accurate measurements of the user's fall risk and gait ability. 

This project works with the tools described above (Microsoft Hololens, Unity Devloper, and Cueforce Treadmill) to create an obstacle course for the user to navigate through virtual reality. After a synchronization stage, while the user walks on the treadmill wearing the headset, blocks will appear ahead and travel to the user at the same speed of the treadmill. Using the sensors from the treadmill, we are able to determine whether the user stepped over the block. Using these metrics with other data provided from the treadmill, researchers are able to calculate a more accurate reading for someone's walking ability and fall risk. 

This data is cruccial for elderly people, people doing physical rehabilition after serious physical accidents, and many more situations, including after stokes.
